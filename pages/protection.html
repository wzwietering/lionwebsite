			<h2>Threats</h2>
			<h3>Poaching</h3>
			<p>Lions are common animals poached in Africa. They are poached for skins, heads and full bodies. These are used for status symbols in the houses of greedy and heartless humans. Lions are also poached for their bones. Due to the decreased number of tigers and the increased protection of the tiger, lion bones are used in "Tiger Bone Cake".</p>
			<h3>Bad Zoos and Circuses</h3>
			<p>Lions in captivity often face torturous mistreatment. Bad Zoos are more common than you think and lions often die very young and from avoidable diseases in bad zoos. Circuses are one of the worst places a lion can go. Lions in circuses always suffer mistreatment and as a result they develop phycological problems as well as physical problems; caused by tricks that involved standing on their hind legs for unnatural periods of time.</p>
			<h3>Canned Hunting</h3>
			<p>Canned Hunting is the situation in which lions are bred to be hunted. When they are cubs they are pet by tourists in "Cub Petting", in their adolescence they are used in the tourist activity known as "Walking With Lions", finally when they reach adulthood they are killed by paying Canned Hunters in a small enclosure from which they can not escape. They are then used as trophies.</p>

			<h2>What can we do?</h2>
			<h3>Raising Awareness</h3>
			<p>Our Mission is to save the lion by raising awareness about the declining number of lions in the wild and canned hunting.</p>
			<h3>Changing Minds</h3>
			<p>Lions are commonly seen as aggressive predators but they love, just like us. They have feelings and know what is happening as much as you or I do. When they are tortured for "Cub Petting" they feel the same as if we were tortured for the entertainment of others.</p>
			<h3>Wake Up The Humans!</h3>
			<p>There are only 15 to 20 thousand lions left in the wild! This number is quickly declining. If we humans don't wake up and pledge to save the Lion, these beautiful, majestic creatures will be gone. Taking the pledge will help raise awareness around the world about the struggle this species faces every day.</p>
			<h3>Restoring The Lion Population</h3>
			<p>We aim to restore the lion population to 450,000 (their numbers in the 1940's).</p>
			<h3>Rescue</h3>
			<p>In the future we aim to set up/fund a sanctuary/reserve in Africa. A place where lions from Bad Zoos, Circuses, Canned Hunting farms and bad owners, can be safe and comfortable to live out their lives in a familiar environment (area native to lions). It can also be a place to preserve the species, a place where wild lions can feel safe from poaching and trophy hunting.</p>
